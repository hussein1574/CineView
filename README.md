# 🎬 CineView

A modern, responsive movie discovery web application built with the latest Angular features. This app uses the TMDB API for movie data and integrates with the Google Gemini AI API for smart search and content summarization.

## ✨ Core Features

- **🎬 Browse & Discover:** View lists of trending movies.
- **🍿 Movie Details:** Click on any movie to see a full details page with poster, backdrop, synopsis, runtime, and more.
- **🔍 Reactive Search:** A smart search bar that uses **RxJS** (`debounceTime`, `switchMap`) to provide instant, real-time results as you type.
- **🤖 AI "Vibe" Search:** Search for movies based on your mood (e.g., "a mind-bending sci-fi movie with a twist"). This feature uses the **Google Gemini API** to get a list of movie titles, then uses **`forkJoin`** to search the TMDB API for all of them in parallel.
- **🧠 AI Summary:** On the movie details page, click "Generate" to get a unique summary for any movie, generated by the **Google Gemini API**.
- **🔐 Authentication:** Full mock login/logout flow using `localStorage` for state persistence.
- **🛡️ Protected Routes:** Implemented **Functional Route Guards** (`CanActivate`) to protect the `/watchlist` (requires login) and `/login` (prevents access if already logged in) routes.
- **❤️ Watchlist:** Add or remove movies from your personal watchlist. The state is tied to your user data in the `AuthService` and persists in `localStorage`.
- **📱 Responsive Design:** A clean, mobile-first UI that scales across all devices, with a functional mobile menu.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Key Concepts

This project was built to showcase modern Angular practices.

- **Angular (v17+):** Built entirely with **Standalone Components**, directives, and pipes.
- **State Management:** Uses **Signals** as the primary state management tool.
  - **`signal()`:** For all mutable component and service state.
  - **`computed()`:** For deriving state reactively (e.g., `bookmarkedIds`, `currentUserName`).
  - **`input()` / `output()`:** For modern, signal-based component communication.
- **Asynchronous Programming:**
  - **RxJS:** Heavily used for handling asynchronous events and API calls.
  - **Operators:** `switchMap` (for reactive search), `forkJoin` (for AI vibe search), `debounceTime`, `distinctUntilChanged`, `map`, `tap`, and `catchError` are all implemented.
- **Forms:** Uses **Reactive Forms** (`FormControl`) for the search and login pages.
- **Core Features:**
  - **`HttpClient`** configured with **`provideHttpClient`** and **`withInterceptors`**.
  - **Smart `Interceptor` (`apiKeysInterceptor`):** A single interceptor that intelligently adds the correct API key based on the request URL (TMDB or Gemini).
  - **Functional Route Guards:** Uses `CanActivateFn` for `authGuard` and `publicGuard`.
  - **`Custom Pipe`:** A `MinutesToHoursPipe` was created to format movie runtimes.
- **Styling:**
  - **TailwindCSS:** The entire UI is built using Tailwind's utility classes.
  - **Custom Global Styles:** Added global styles for fonts, custom scrollbars, and loaders.
- **Documentation:**
  - Includes a detailed `API_SETUP.md` guide for easy configuration.
  - `.gitignore` is properly configured to exclude sensitive `environment.ts` files.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) (v17+)

### Installation & Setup

    cd CineView
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up API Keys:**
    This project requires API keys from TMDB and Google Gemini.

    - Follow the detailed instructions in the [**API_SETUP.md**](API_SETUP.md) file to get your keys and create your `environment.ts` file.

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
